[Work Updates till now](UPDATES.md)
### Our Project is to successfully make a chat bot which can be used for controlling home appliances such as lights and multi-speed fans.
### Once we were on a smooth track in accordance with the plan of action, the Team decided to have a trigger name for the bot to make it more user friendly. Many names were suggested and voted for and finally we came up with something simple and yet specialâ€¦.
### S.A.S.H.A 
### Smart Artificial System for Home Automation
### The name aptly describes our smart chatbot and its use in Home Automation. 
# Name of the Bot on telegram is :- @Team_Automated_Bot
# Features of the Bot
### Password protected
### Can change password
### Informs the owners of chatbot for password change through E-Mail
### Asks the user for name and assigns the chat a particular name and creates a DataBase for the Same
### Can detect various commands like hi,hello etc and reply accordingly
### Can switch on/off fans lights etc via commands
### Logs the commands into a csv file for history reference
### If a device is On and someone inputs to on it, bot replies with message as it's already on and vice-versa
### It replies in an informative manner when someone ask it what can it do, etc 
### The code for Alexa integration is ready and we are waiting for the hardware to arrive.
# Final Project Expectations
### Final project would be a Hardware model which would include some Prototype devices like light, fan,etc. which we can control with the help of our ChatBot via Telegram.
### The Work of Alexa Integration would get complete and thus, we can also operate our devices with the help of Alexa.
### Our Chatbot will also be able to have basic conversation with humans and also give information regarding news, weather,etc.
### We are also thinking of creating a website for our project which would be able to answer all the queries regarding S.A.S.H.A and give a brief introduction of the various features
