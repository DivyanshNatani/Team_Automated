Our Project is to successfully make a chat bot which can be used for controlling home appliances such as lights and multi-speed fans.
Once we were on a smooth track in accordance with the plan of action, the Team decided to have a trigger name for the bot to make it more user friendly. Many names were suggested and voted for and finally we came up with something simple and yet specialâ€¦.
S.A.S.H.A 
Smart Artificial System for Home Automation
The name aptly describes our smart chatbot and its use in Home Automation. 
## Features of the Bot
Password protected
Can change password
Informs the owners of chatbot for password change through E-Mail
Asks the user for name and assigns the chat a particular name and creates a DataBase for the Same
Can detect various commands like hi,hello etc and reply accordingly
Can switch on/off fans lights etc via commands
Logs the commands into a csv file for history reference
If a device is On and someone inputs to on it, bot replies with message as it's already on and vice-versa
It replies in an informative manner when someone ask it what can it do, etc 
The code for Alexa integration is ready and we are waiting for the hardware to arrive.
